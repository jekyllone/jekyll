  > "Jekyll is everything that I ever wanted in a blogging engine. Really. It isn't perfect, but what's excellent about it is that if there's something wrong, I know exactly how it works and how to fix it. It runs on the your machine only, and is essentially an added"build" step between you and the browser. I coded this entire site in TextMate using standard HTML5 and CSS3, and then at the end I added just a few little variables to the markup. Presto-chango, my site is built and I am at peace with the world."
